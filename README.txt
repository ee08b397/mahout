Welcome to Apache Mahout! Mahout is a scalable machine learning library that implements many 
different approaches to machine learning. The project currently contains implementations of 
algorithms for classification, clustering, frequent item set mining, genetic programming and 
collaborative filtering. Mahout is scalable along three dimensions: It scales to reasonably 
large data sets by leveraging algorithm properties or implementing versions based on Apache Hadoop. 
It scales to your perferred business case as it is distributed under a commercially friendly 
license. In addition it scales in terms of support by providing a vibrant, responsive and 
diverse community. ### This is a working copy of the original repository, not the original
